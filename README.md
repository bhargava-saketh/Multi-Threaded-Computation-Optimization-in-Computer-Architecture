### Introduction
The "Computation Optimization in Computer Architecture" project explores different matrix multiplication optimization techniques, ranging from a simple single-threaded implementation to advanced multi-threading approaches. By comparing sequential and parallel computing, this project illustrates how effective workload distribution and multi-core CPU utilization can drastically improve performance. This technology has applications in fields like scientific computing, data analytics, and any domain where large-scale matrix operations are crucial for system performance.

### Tasks Completed
The development of this project involved a series of optimization tasks, each building upon the previous version to demonstrate improvements in computational efficiency. Key accomplishments include:

1. **Single-Threaded Matrix Multiplication**:
   - Implemented a baseline matrix multiplication algorithm using a single thread to compute the product of two 1000x1000 matrices.
   - This version sets the foundation for understanding computation complexity and provides a performance benchmark for comparison.

2. **Sequential Matrix Splitting for Load Balancing**:
   - Implemented a workload splitting technique that divides the matrix into two parts and processes them sequentially.
   - The goal was to experiment with better workload distribution to assess any gains in load balancing without introducing concurrency.

3. **Single-Threaded Matrix Splitting with Data Management**:
   - Further developed the sequential splitting approach by organizing the workload into smaller, logically independent sections.
   - Although still single-threaded, this technique structures the data to facilitate the transition to parallel processing.

4. **Multi-Threaded Matrix Multiplication**:
   - Created a multi-threaded version that uses two threads to concurrently compute the matrix multiplication for different halves of the matrix.
   - This version demonstrates the power of utilizing multiple CPU cores, leading to significant speedups in matrix computations by dividing the work between two processing units.

5. **Performance Testing and Evaluation**:
   - Conducted extensive testing and timing evaluations to compare the performance of each implementation.
   - Analyzed how splitting the workload and utilizing threads effectively reduces computation time and increases efficiency.

### Results
The results of the various implementations are summarized in the `results` folder, where timing comparisons show that multi-threading yields the most efficient results compared to the sequential versions. Detailed analysis files include graphs and tables for each approach.

### Conclusion
This project demonstrates the profound impact of multi-threading and load balancing in large-scale matrix operations. By moving from a basic single-threaded version to advanced parallel implementations, the project showcases how computational workloads can be significantly optimized using threading.
